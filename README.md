# SharedSpaceVR_Research
Files from Research Project being done with [Krishna Suresh](https://github.com/Krishna2308) and [Prof. Christos Mousas](https://github.com/christosmousas).

Our goal is to create a virtual escape room prototype for game developers to use in the future to create virtual multiplayer games.

## PathFinder.java
Naive path finding algorithm that creates a path in a given room given the obstacles in that room.

#### To Do:
- [ ] Add different cube types to add to the path to maximize usage of free space 
- [ ] Optimize path generation based on the chosen cost/difficulty by the user
- [x] Add layer functionality
